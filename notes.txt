SDL2 is also installed through Homebrew:

{fmt} and GLM both work here.

Additionally, when I tried the examples in that repository:
the C++11 and C11 versions compiled without issue, albeit with a bug:
the executable starts, but no window appears. The executable then stops shortly afterwards.

The D version also works, but has the same bug. In both cases, to resolve the bug,
I had to add an event loop:

(D)
```
void main() {
    ...
    ...
    ...

    // Polling for events
    SDL_Event event;
    bool quit = false;
    while(!quit) {
        while (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {
            if (event.type == SDL_QUIT) {
                quit = true;
            }

            if (event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN) {
                quit = true;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
